STRUCTURE of the DataFrame 'trackProperties'
loadNodes returns a DataFrame, which can be used for the sorting and calculations.
It is importend that the columns of the DataFrame have alway the Symbols [:ID, :x, :y, :z], because the functions will call them by these names.
Thats why the order of the columns in the DataFrame isn't importend.
=#

#=
Because the calculations aren't working without x and y values, the Nodes get deleted, when these values are missing.
The IDs and z coordinates aren't so importend. If they are missing, they get a zero.
With this function it is possible to import Data without a z column
=#

    missingID = false
    missingZ = false
    for row in 1:size(trackProperties,1)
        if string(trackProperties[row,:x]) == "missing"
            @warn "x-value is missing around row $row with ID $(trackProperties[row, :ID]). The Node got deleted"
        elseif string(trackProperties[row,:y]) == "missing"
            @warn "y-value is missing around row $row with ID $(trackProperties[row, :ID]). The Node got deleted"

        end

The imported file should contain columns in the same order as the order in 'columnNames'.
The first two rows of the PT file will be skipped because they contains the header. If there isn't any header the first tow nodes of the CSV file get lost.
